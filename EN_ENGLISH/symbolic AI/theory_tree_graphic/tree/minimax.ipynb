    "# Minimax algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is often used in 2 player games, like chess, checkers, Go or tic tac toe. The aim is to determine the best move to make in a given position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm will start by representing the game as a tree. Each node will represent a possible position of the game and each branch will represent a possible move for the player\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will then alternate between two types of nodes in our tree. The \"MAX\" and \"MIN\" nodes.\n",
    "- The \"MAX\" nodes represent the positions when the player known as MAX needs to play, he's searching to maximise his score.\n",
    "- The \"MIN\" nodes represent the positions when the player known as MIN needs to play, this one is searching to minimise the score of the MAX player (which means maximising the MIN player's score)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the leaf nodes, the algorithm will use an evaluation function.For example, in the case of games , this functions assigns a value to each final position of the game. For example +1 if MAX wins, -1 if MIN wins and 0 for a stalemate. The values of the leaf nodes will spread along the branches of the tree to the root. At each \"MAX\" node, the maximum value of those threads will spread to the top (they climb up the tree). However, at each \"MIN\" node it's the minimum value of those threads that will spread to the top. To choose the best move when all the values have been spread to the root, we choose the move that leads to the position with the maximum value (the largest for example). This move is considered as the best one to play in the current position.\n",

    "### How the Minimax algorithm works in the TicTacToe class\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm is an decision analysis method used in two player games with complete information, like the Tic Tac Toe game. In the TicTacToe class, the minimax algorithm is used by the computer to find the best possible move to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The minimax algorithm goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the minimax algorithm is to maximise the chances of gaining points for the maximizing player (he computer in general) while minimizing the chances of gaining points of the opponent. It explores the search tree of the game to assess each possible position and choose the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation in the TicTacToe class\n",
    "\n",
    "The TicTacToe class contains the following methods related to the minimax algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `minimax(self, player)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method implements the minimax algorithm to find the best possible move for a given player. It uses a recursive approach to explore the search tree of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the 'X' player won, returns -1.\n",
    "- If the 'O' player won, returns 1.\n",
    "- If none of the players won and the board is full, returns 0.\n",
    "- For the 'O' player (computer) :\n",
    " - Maximizes the score by exploring the possible moves.\n",
    " - Uses the recursivity to assess each possible position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `best_move(self)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method find the best possible move for the 'O' player (computer) by using the minimax algorithm. It evaluates each possible move and chooses the one with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the minimax algorithm is used in the `play()` method of the TicTacToe class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The computer ('O' player) uses `best_move()` to choose the best move to play.\n",
    "2. The minimax algorithm explores the search tree until a specific depth to evaluate each possible position.\n",
    "3. Depending on the calculated scores, the computer chooses the move that maximizes its chances to gain points.\n",
    "4. The game continues untils a player wins or the board is full, and the outcome of the game is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The flaws of the Minimax algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimax algorithm has many flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It needs a complete exploration of the game tree. To take the best decision, the Minimax algorithm needs to explore every single branch of the tree. This may be inefficient because a lot of branches can be created depending on the complexity of the game.\n",
    "- The inability to take the next moves of the opponent into account, which can lead to sub-optimal decisions.\n",
    "- Sensitive to the search tree size. The performance of the minimax algorithm directly depends on the size of the search tree. In the gales with a great number of possible moves at each turn, the computing time of the algorithm can be very far away, if not impossible to solve in a reasonable time.\n",
    "- Only works for zero-sum games. The Minimax algorithm is made for zero-sum games, where the gain of a player is the same as the loss of the other. In games with more complex earning dynamics, such as cooperative games or games with delayed rewards, the Minimax algorithm may not be applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some methods exist to optimize to Minimax algorithm to try to use it at larger scales of board that contain a lot more possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic is an evaluation function allowing to improve the performance of the algorithm by reducing the size of the search tree. It will assign a numeric value to a game state, representing the performance of this state for a given player. By using this function our minimax algorithm will be able to prune (cut/delete) the branches of our tree that are not promising. This allows to reduce the computing time of our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example :\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Connect 4 game, an heuristic evaluation function could assign a positive value to the states where the player has more lined up tokens than the opponent, and a negative value to the states where the opponent has more lined up tokens than the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The alpha-beta pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha-beta pruning is an optimization method which allows to reduce the size of the search tree. It uses the value gaps to prune the irrelevant branches of the tree. In our Minimax algorithm, each node of the search tree is paired with a value that represents the quality of this state for a given player. This method uses two values, called alpha and beta that represent the upper and lower limits of irrevelant values' gap for the decision of the final move. Along the exploration of the search tree by the minimax algorithm, it updates the alpha and beta value depending on the values of the explored nodes. If a node has a value outside the [apha, beta] gap, the algorithm can prune the whole branch of the search tree corresponding to this node, since this branch will be irrelevant for the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of \"pruning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is a method used in computer science to reduce the complexity of an algorithm by avoiding the exploration of specific parts of a search area.\n",
    "In the context of the minimax algorithm, pruning consists of not exploring the branches of the tree that are irrelevant for the optimal decision."
